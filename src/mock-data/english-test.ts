Crocodile Rock Ravi is a little boy who lives with his mother and father. He loves animals and often dreams about exciting animal adventures. Every night, before he goes to bed, his mother reads him one of his favourite stories.
Ravi is more excited than usual this evening because he is learning about crocodiles at school, and tomorrow he is going on an outing to the crocodile farm. He can hardly sleep because he is so excited. His mother reads him a book about crocodiles. It is called "Crocodile Rock". It is one of his favourite books. He enjoys the story and soon falls asleep.
Early the next morning Ravi gets up and gets ready for school. He has his breakfast, brushes his teeth and gets dressed in his school uniform. He looks very smart. When he arrives at school the bus is already waiting to take the children to the crocodile farm. Ravi is the first boy to board the bus. He is able to sit at the window. It takes one hour to get to the crocodile farm and a lovely lady is there to greet the children and take them on a tour. She teaches them all about crocodiles and Ravi learns many new facts. He learns that crocodiles are reptiles and that some live in the sea, while others live in rivers. The lady also tells the children that crocodiles sometimes eat rocks to help them digest their food. Ravi does not think rocks make a tasty dinner.
Ravi's friend Josh is very naughty. He climbs on top of the wall to get a closer look at the crocodiles. The crocodiles are lying in the sun and look like rocks. Suddenly Josh loses his balance and falls into the crocodile den. "Oh no!" shouts his teacher. She calls the crocodile lady. The crocodile lady laughs. "Don't worry, those crocs aren't crocs, they are rocks."
Poor Josh does not laugh. He thinks he is crocodile dinner! I don't think he will be so naughty next time.
